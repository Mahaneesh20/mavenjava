Now you can watch the new child is been added to the parent project.
Note: Childs or Modules can be added to the projects who have the packaging type as pom. If we try to create a module within child1 it is not possible since its packaging is opted to JAR.
Linking two modules in a Parent Project:
Go to the module u want to connect. And add a dependency to other module on which the current module depends. For example if my child2 is dependent on child1. I have to change the dependencies in the pom.xml by adding a new dependency of child1.
Steps to add dependency:
Goto pom.xml of child2.
Navigate to dependencies tag. Update the dependencies with child1 dependency as given below, and save pom.xml after update.
<dependency>
		<groupId>KMIT</groupId>
			<artifactId>MultimoduleChild1</artifactId>
			<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
